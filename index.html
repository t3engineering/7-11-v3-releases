<h2>7-Eleven iOS Builds</h2>
<p>
If this is your first time installing 7-Eleven, you will need to trust the app after installing it on your iPhone. Launch Settings ‚û°Ô∏è General, then scroll down to Device Management and tap it. It's self explanatory from there.

<h3>Release 0.03 (1)</h3>
<p>
‚ú® Shiny new designs for our entire register / sign-in flow!
</p>
<p>
‚è∞ Loading indicator shows while policies are loaded in the register flow.
</p>
<p>
üí¨ The "Done" button will enable/disable as you're typing your information while signing in or registering. Sign-in currently has no validation, so as long as you have text in both fields, you can tap the sign-in button.

<h3>Release 0.02 (3)</h3>
<p>
	üêû Fixed bug where offers wouldn't show up periodically.
</p>
<p>
	üë§ App loads straight to home screen. Tap account icon for account page. Tap "Sign Out" to go to beginning of login flow.
</p>
<p>
	üö´ If your active register field has an error displayed, and the field re-validates while the label is visible, the label animates to show the user that the error still applies.

<h3>Release 0.02 (2)</h3>
<p>
	The login flow is now connected to the home controller. Tapping on the account icon in the home controller brings you back to the beginning of the login flow.
</p>
<p>
	Also, the login flow now begins with "How It Works".
</p>

<p>
	Lastly, tapping any of the policies (privacy policy, email communications, etc.) loads our web view controller which, at the moment, may load a privacy policy, Google Japan, or a pikachu üòä.

<h3>Release 0.02 (1)</h3>
<p>
	Most important and visible changes here are the form validation rules on the register fields, and the addition of some styling we received from Zeplin.

<h3>Release 0.01 (1)</h3>
<p>
	This is our first build to QA. Our versioning convention is 0.NN (M) where NN is the sprint number and M is the build number in this sprint. So the 7th build of the 12th sprint would be 0.12 (7).
</p>

<p>
	We follow this convention until we get to 1.x, where we then follow regular versioning.
