		<h2>7-Eleven iOS Builds</h2>
		<p>
			If this is your first time installing 7-Eleven, you will need to trust the app after installing it on your iPhone.
		</p>

		<p>
			Launch Settings ➡️ General, then scroll down to Device Management and tap it. It's self explanatory from there.
		</p>

		<h3>Release 0.03 (1)</h3>
		<p>
			✨ Shiny new designs for our entire register / sign-in flow!
		</p>
		<p>
			⏰ Loading indicator shows while policies are loaded in the register flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			💬 The "Done" button will enable/disable as you're typing your information while signing in or registering. Sign-in currently has no validation, so as long as you have text in both fields, you can tap the sign-in button.
		</p>

		<h3>Release 0.02 (3)</h3>
		<p>
			🐞 Fixed bug where offers wouldn't show up periodically.
		</p>
		<p>
			👤 App loads straight to home screen. Tap account icon for account page. Tap "Sign Out" to go to beginning of login flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			🚫 If your active register field has an error displayed, and the field re-validates while the label is visible, the label animates to show the user that the error still applies.

		<h3>Release 0.02 (2)</h3>
		<p>
			The login flow is now connected to the home controller. Tapping on the account icon in the home controller brings you back to the beginning of the login flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, the login flow now begins with "How It Works".
		</p>

		<p>
			Lastly, tapping any of the policies (privacy policy, email communications, etc.) loads our web view controller which, at the moment, may load a privacy policy, Google Japan, or a pikachu 😊.

		<h3>Release 0.01 (1)</h3>
		<p>
			This is our first build to QA. Our versioning convention is 0.NN (M) where NN is the sprint number and M is the build number in this sprint. So the 7th build of the 12th sprint would be 0.12 (7).
		</p>

		<p>
			We follow this convention until we get to 1.x, where we then follow regular versioning.
